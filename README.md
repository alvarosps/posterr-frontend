# Base React Project

This is a base project template for a React application, with the latest versions of React, Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and Prettier. Created by @alvarosps

## Getting Started

### Important: For now the application does not support user authentication, but since the backend requires it, there is a

`const mockUserId = 1`

### variable in the NewPostForm component and in the usePosts hook, you can modify it if necessary to create/repost as different users.

#### You'll need to run the [Posterr Backend application](https://github.com/alvarosps/posterr-backend) to have this application properly working

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies:
   `npm install`

2. Start the development server:
   `npm start`

### Testing

`npm run test`

### ESLint checks and ESLint Fixes

-   `npm run lint`
-   `npm run lint:fix`

### Prettier checks and Prettier Fixes

-   `npm run prettier`
-   `npm run prettier:fix`

## Deployment

-   This will be specific to the project and where it is being deployed.
-   For now, we have a build script, and a webpack suited for production.
-   Might need to add more scripts and files for deployment and hot-reloading in deployment (depends on the platform)
    `npm run build`

## Critique and Reflection

### Potential Improvements

If given more time, there are several areas in this project I would consider improving:

-   Error Handling: Currently, the error handling logic in this application is quite basic. We could improve it by providing more specific error messages, and by handling different types of errors (like network errors, timeouts, etc.) differently.

-   UI/UX: While the application is functional, it could benefit from a more polished and user-friendly design. Features such as loading indicators, toast notifications for actions, and improved error messages could enhance the user experience.

-   Testing: More comprehensive testing could be done to ensure application robustness. This would include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using tools such as Jest and React Testing Library.

-   Code Organization: Some parts of the code could be further modularized and cleaned up. For instance, the API logic could be separated from the component files and placed in its own directory.

### Scalability

If this project were to grow and have many users and posts, there are several parts that might fail or become bottlenecks:

-   Database: The current database queries might not be able to handle a very large volume of data efficiently. We might need to consider optimizing our database queries, indexing, and potentially partitioning the data for better performance.

-   API Rate Limiting: Without proper rate limiting, the application could be vulnerable to spamming and DDoS attacks. Implementing rate limiting on the server would be necessary to prevent excessive requests from a single client.

-   State Management: As the application grows, managing state could become more complex. We might need to consider using a more robust state management solution such as Redux or MobX.

In order to scale this product effectively, we would need to take several steps and potentially incorporate additional technologies:

-   Load Balancing: As traffic increases, we would need to distribute the load across multiple servers using a load balancer.

-   Caching: To reduce database load and improve response times, we could implement a caching mechanism using tools like Redis.

-   Microservices: If the application becomes very large, we might consider breaking it up into microservices. This would make the application more modular and easier to manage and scale.

-   CDN for Static Assets: As the number of users grows globally, we could use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets faster to users, regardless of their geographical location.

-   Monitoring and Logging: Implementing proper monitoring and logging would be crucial to detect and fix issues quickly. Tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana could be used for this purpose.
